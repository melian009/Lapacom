abstract = {Intertidal limpets are subject to harvesting pressure in regions, e.g. oceanic islands, where marine organisms are a more accessible source of protein. These molluscs are very sensitive to human exploitation which often results on a decrease of their densities and an over-representation of immature individuals, because of the loss of large-sized reproductive specimens. Two species of exploited limpets (Patella aspera and Patella candei) were assessed throughout 21 years, before (1996–2006) and after (2007–2017) the implementation of conservation measures for their sustainable management in Madeira (North-eastern Atlantic Ocean). Different levels of anthropogenic pressure were also taken in account in this comparative study: (i) proximity to coastal settlements (“Near” vs. “Far”) and (ii) accessibility to the coast (North vs. South), that may be considered surrogates of harvesting pressure on the intertidal of Madeira. The present results showed that the stocks of P. aspera and P. candei are slightly recovered after regulatory measures entered into force, with an increase of mean shell length and dominance of reproductive individuals ({\textgreater}40 mm). P. aspera populations showed a clearer effect mainly due to the higher exploitation rate relative to P. candei. Conservation measures prompted a positive effect on both exploited limpet species, but further assessment studies are necessary to address the evolution of stocks over time.},

@article{Sousa2019a,
abstract = {Intertidal and shallow subtidal molluscs are highly sensitive to overharvesting because of their restricted habitat, limited mobility and easy access to humans. Several parameters have been previously used to determine their exploitation status, e.g. sizes, abundances and reproductive stages. Herein the reproductive parameters of two exploited limpets, Patella candei and the protandrous hermaphrodite Patella aspera were examined. Limpets were collected “before” (1996–2006) and “after” (2007–2017) the implementation of management measures aiming to preserve limpet populations in Madeira Island (NE Atlantic Ocean). The proportion of reproductive individuals increased approximately 14{\%} after the implementation of management measures for both species. An increase in the size and age at first maturity of both species (from 34.6 to 37.5 mm in P. aspera and from 33.4 to 37.4 mm in P. candei) also occurred after such implementation. “Before” samples of P. aspera showed male-biased populations (1.7:1) shifting towards a balanced sex ratio (1:1) after the regulations. No “before” nor “after” sex ratio variations were observed in P. candei populations. Reproductive parameters revealed feasible to determine the efficiency of the implementation of management measures and to detect a slight improvement in reproductive potential of both limpet species.},

@article{Faria2018,
abstract = {The genetic erosion of populations exposed to human exploitation plays a detrimental role on a species ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The Macaronesia (NE Atlantic) endemic limpet Patella aspera (R{\"{o}}ding 1798) has been subject to overexploitation throughout its geographic distribution. We analysed 841 limpet specimens from eleven islands across the archipelagos of Azores, Madeira and Canaries. Results from 11 nuclear microsatellite markers showed significant population structure between populations from Azores and populations from Madeira and Canaries, and absence of current or historic gene flow between these. M-ratios showed that both population clusters have experienced demographic changes over time. Heterozygote deficits were common across populations, which can be better accounted for by inbreeding than by null alleles or Wahlund effect. Such levels of inbreeding are likely a consequence of a significant reduction of reproductive units due to decades of intensive exploitation. As a sequential protandrous hermaphrodite, the size-selective harvesting of larger individuals likely fosters unbalanced sex-ratios and a consequent reproductive shortage. A recent compensatory hypothesis suggests that males are compensating the removal of larger females by undergoing sex change earlier and presumably at smaller sizes, as an adaptive response of the species under high size-biased fishing pressure. Despite such response, a dramatic reduction of Ne emerging from a large variation in the reproductive success due to overfishing and artificial genetic drift, can simply explain the inbreeding scenario observed in this Macaronesia endemic key species. This study provides valuable insights for management and conservation of P. aspera throughout Macaronesia.},
