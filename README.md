## Modeling

# Theory
* ODEs system to explore the extinction probability in a exploitation-competition Simple Life Cycle (SLC) model.

# Theory-empirical (see table 1 main ms)
* Fit distance to human vs number of reproductives and extinction probability under the SLC and CLC scenarios for the case of Madeira:
* Language: julia
* Package: Flux.jl
