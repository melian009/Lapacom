## Lapacom
Metacommunity dynamics of complex life-cycles in exploited seascapes

## Questions

* Predicting extinction probabilities in two metapopulations with and without interactions across a disturbance gradient (Leslie matrix in space)

* Spatiotemporal synchrony promoted by humans?

* Do control sites exhibit higher asyncrhony? (Madeira)

* Richness peaks in the sites with intermediate connections? (Lower richness in the more isolated (connected) sites?) :: Richness here can be a trait

## Data

* Canary Islands and Madeira 
* Main features of the data -- pros/cons
* Distance matrix 
        
## Code

* Preliminary Octave version of Leslie matrix in space 
* Julia updated version
