Complex life cycle metacommunities in disturbed landscapes


Questions

Predicting extinction probabilities in two metapopulations with and without interactions across a disturbance gradient (Leslie matrix in space)

Spatiotemporal synchrony promoted by humans?

Do control sites exhibit higher asyncrhony? (Madeira)

Richness peaks in the sites with intermediate connections? (Lower richness in the more isolated (connected) sites?) :: Richness here can be a trait
