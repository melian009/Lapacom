LAPACOM (MODEL)

(1) SPATIAL STRUCTURE: STATIC
  1.1. Site matrix, containing 3 vectors, size, exposition and extraction (0 < S < Smax)
  1.2. Distance matrix (0 < Dij < Dmax)
(2)  AGENTS: Dynamic Spatial and Temporal
  2.1. Features
       Egg (A), Trocophore (B), Veliger (C), Juvenile (D), Adult (E)
       Transition between stages driven by hours post-fertilization
  2.2. Traits
       Mating ((1)External fecundation, (2)random encounter (Lottery model), (3) Exponential decay vs. fertilized eggs per time)
  2.3. Abiotic ((1)Exposition-Extraction trade-offs,(2) Currents to calculate distance between site distance)
  2.4. Biotic 
      Human ((1)Close season (December to March) , (2) Extraction probability dependent function size 
      (40 mm in Madeira, with 15 kg/day for professional, 45 mm in Canaries, with 10 kg/day for professional and 3 kg/day for recreative), 
      Extraction dependent on size
      Natural (Death probability independent to size)
 2.5. Dispersal (Larger size, more eggs; Global dispersion (A, B), Regional dispersion (B, C), Local dispersion (C), No dispersion (D, E))
